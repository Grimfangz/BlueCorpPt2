Still to implement:
  - retries for file upload (Maybe Polly.Retry)
  - Static Ip (via virtual NAT Gateway) for white listing
  - File size hard restriction
  - Unit tests/integration testing with sample payload and expected results

Possible Future Enhancements:
  - Terraform to generate and regenerate all azure resources
  - Optimize trigger mechanisms and time intervals (cost benefits)
  - Different environments dev qa prod setup on github
  - Alternative way to store schemas and mappings to allow easier switch/versioning support
  - Email notifications to update progress
  - storage of records (maybe periodic clean up)
  - Ui/Admin page to view and download stored records
